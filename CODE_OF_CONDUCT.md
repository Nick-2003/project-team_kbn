# Code of Conduct

[The text below is adapted from the Code of Conduct for DSCI 310](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/dsci-310-student/coc.html).

## Introduction

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in this project is required to conform to the team's Code of Conduct.

We are committed to fostering an open, inclusive, and respectful environment for all participants in this project. We welcome individuals from all backgrounds and are dedicated to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that diversity and inclusivity leads to stronger, more effective teamwork in which all members feel safe, valued, and empowered to contribute.

We as members, contributors, and leaders do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind and pledge to make participation in our community a safe and healthy experience.

All members of the Team KBN project team are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. All reports will be reviewed by the team and will be kept strictly confidential.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by Team KBN including, but not limited to, group meetings, email communication, pull request feedback, discussion boards (e.g. Github issues), social media, private messaging applications (e.g. Instagram) or other events where Team KBN is represented.

## A Statement on diversity and inclusivity

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.

We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, age, body size, visible or invisible disability, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, familial status, nationality, race, ethnicity, religion or belief (or lack thereof), personal appearance, genetic information or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected behaviour

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should strive to be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Treating everyone with equal respect
- Being open to differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- Maintaining confidentiality with reports of harassment or violations of the Code of Conduct
- Acknowledging and celebrating diversity in all its forms

## Unacceptable behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants on any platform or at any event in which Team KBN is represented include:

- Discriminatory, offensive, or harmful language with the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- Bullying or intimidation of any kind, including but not limited to physical or verbal abuse, unwelcome attention, or stalking
- Incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm, causing someone to fear for their safety
- Deliberately undermining the contributions of other participants or belittling their work
- The display of sexual or violent images
- Intentional or repeated misgendering
- Microaggressions, whether intentional or unintentional
- Sustained disruption of meetings, events or communications
- Excessive intoxication
- Nonconsensual physical contact
- Continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop publication of private communication without consent

## Consequences for unacceptable behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any platform or event where Team KBN is represented, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behavior that violates the Code of Conduct, the team may warn the offender and or engage the DSCI 320 Instructor to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions. Consequences may include temporary or permanent removal from the project, bans from the project's communication channels (e.g. Github issues, emails, private messaging applications, etc.), and reports to appropriate authorities in cases of legal violations.
