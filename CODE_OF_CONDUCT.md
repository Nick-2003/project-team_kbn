# Code of Conduct

[This text is from GitHub's Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project).

A code of conduct defines standards for how to engage in a community.
It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions.
It also outlines procedures for addressing problems between members of your project's community.
For more information on why a code of conduct defines standards and expectations for how to engage in a community, see the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/).
