## Introduction

The Public Tree Dataset, published by the City of Vancouver and maintained by the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation, provides detailed information about public trees across the city. This dataset includes data on tree location, species, size, planting date, and geographic coordinates. Private trees are excluded from this dataset. Updates are performed daily on weekdays, with tree attributes refreshed regularly; however, some attributes may take several years to update due to varying priorities and resource availability (City of Vancouver, 2025). For this analysis, we are using data last modified on March 4th, 2025.

The City of Vancouver leverages this dataset as part of its Healthy City Strategy, which aims to improve the physical and mental health of residents by creating environments that foster well-being (City of Vancouver, 2018, n.d.-a). The urban forest plays a pivotal role in achieving these goals, offering numerous benefits such as cleaner air, carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat creation, and protection against storms, extreme heat, and climate change impacts (City of Vancouver, n.d.).

To enhance the dataset's value, we integrated external databases to add two new columns. The FAMILY_NAME column maps tree genus names to their respective families using the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database. Since family is a higher taxonomic rank than genus, this addition provides broader insights into the relationships between tree species. The HAS_POLLEN column indicates whether a tree produces pollen, based on classifications in the Palynological Database (PalDat). This helps assess the impact of trees on urban environments and outdoor activities, particularly for individuals sensitive to allergies. All external data usage complies with the respective terms of use, including proper attribution, and adheres strictly to non-commercial licensing requirements: GBIF (CC BY) and PalDat (educational/non-commercial use).

During exploratory data analysis, we observed that a significant number of samples—3,928, to be precise—had missing values (NA) in the NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME column. Visualizing these missing entries on a map revealed distinct patterns. Many points were concentrated in Stanley Park and areas around UBC, particularly in the West Point Grey neighborhood, including Spanish Bank. A smaller subset of points appeared to belong to existing neighborhoods but were likely missed during data collection. To address this issue, we used the Overpass API, an open-source tool developed by Geofabrik GmbH, to retrieve geographical boundaries for Stanley Park and West Point Grey/Spanish Bank (Geofabrik GmbH, n.d.). We then assigned NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME values to points falling within these boundaries. Additionally, we utilized the Local Area Boundary dataset from the City of Vancouver's Open Data Portal, which contains the geographical boundaries of all neighborhoods in Vancouver, to further refine our analysis.

Our team consists of Kaylee Li, Brianna Zhou, and Nicholas Tam. In alignment with the dataset’s original purpose, our primary goal is to optimize tree placement and management to maximize sustainability and recreational benefits for Vancouver’s urban environment. By improving the accuracy and utility of the dataset, we aim to support evidence-based decision-making that enhances the quality of life for Vancouver residents.

The intended audience for this dataset includes urban foresters, city planners, local communities, and ecologists. Ecologists can leverage the diversity of tree species for research purposes, while local communities and city planners can identify optimal locations for recreation. Urban foresters, on the other hand, can utilize the data to develop tree-planting strategies that further enhance the city’s environmental quality. Together, these stakeholders can work toward a more sustainable and resilient urban ecosystem.
