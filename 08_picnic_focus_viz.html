      <p><strong>Chlorophyll Map</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Position :</strong> Geographic boundaries represent neighborhoods, offering spatial context for tall
          tree distributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Color :</strong> Encodes tall tree counts using a gradient (greens scheme), making it easy to spot
          areas with high tall tree densities.
          <ul>
            <li>The use of a single color gradient aligns with the principle of data-ink ratio, maximizing the

      <h4>Interaction and UI Widgets</h4>

      <p><strong>Height Slider:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Filters trees based on a minimum height threshold (e.g., "At Least Height: 40ft"). This ensures the
          visualization focuses on tall trees, aligning with the goal of identifying mature vegetation
          suitable for picnic environments. This supports filtering tasks by allowing users to refine their analysis
          dynamically.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Neighborhood Dropdown:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allows users to select a specific neighborhood, dynamically updating both the map
          and bar chart. Enables focused analysis by neighborhood, ensuring the visualization adapts to the user's
          chosen area. This supports retrieve value and filter tasks.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Linked Filtering:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Synchronizes the map and bar chart. Selecting a neighborhood updates both
          visualizations. Creates a cohesive exploration experience, reducing cognitive load and enhancing usability.
          This aligns with best practices for interaction idioms, such as linked highlighting.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Conditional Highlighting:</strong></p>
      <ul>

          slider).</li>
        <li><strong>Compute Derived Value :</strong> Aggregated metrics like total tree count and tall tree count per
          neighborhood are computed and displayed.</li>
        <li><strong>Find Extremum :</strong> The map highlights neighborhoods with the highest tall tree densities,
          while the bar chart identifies dominant height ranges.</li>
        <li><strong>Sort :</strong> Neighborhoods are implicitly ranked by tall tree counts (via color intensity on the
          map), and height ranges are sorted by tree count in the bar chart.</li>
        <li><strong>Determine Range :</strong> The map's color scale visualizes the span of tall tree counts across
          neighborhoods.</li>
        <li><strong>Characterize Distribution :</strong> The combination of the map and bar chart allows users to
          analyze the spread of tall trees spatially and compositionally.</li>
