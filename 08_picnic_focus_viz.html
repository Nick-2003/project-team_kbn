      <p><strong>Chlorophyll Map</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Displays tall tree counts across Vancouver neighborhoods.</li>
        <li>The geospatial layout provides geographic context, helping users quickly identify areas with high
          concentrations of mature vegetation.</li>
        <li>Color intensity (greens scheme) encodes tall tree counts, emphasizing neighborhoods with the highest
          densities of tall trees.</li>
        <li>This choice leverages the Gestalt principle of similarity, grouping neighborhoods with comparable tall tree
          densities through consistent color gradients.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Bar Chart</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shows the distribution of trees by height range within the selected neighborhood.</li>
        <li>Bar lengths encode tree counts for each height range, enabling detailed analysis of tree height composition.
        </li>
        <li>Sorting height ranges by count supports tasks like characterizing distribution and finding extrema.</li>

      <p><strong>Chlorophyll Map</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Position :</strong> Geographic boundaries represent neighborhoods, offering spatial context for tall
          tree distributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Color :</strong> Encodes tall tree counts using a gradient (greens scheme), making it easy to spot
          areas with high tall tree densities.
          <ul>
            <li>The use of a single color gradient aligns with the principle of data-ink ratio, maximizing the
              proportion of ink used to display data while minimizing distractions.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Opacity :</strong> Highlights the selected neighborhood in full opacity while dimming others,
          focusing user attention on the chosen area.
          <ul>
            <li>This technique reduces visual clutter and enhances figure-ground differentiation.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h4>Interaction and UI Widgets</h4>

      <p><strong>Height Slider:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Filters trees based on a minimum height threshold (e.g., "At Least Height: 40ft"). This ensures the
          visualization focuses on tall trees, aligning with the goal of identifying mature vegetation
          suitable for picnic environments. This supports filtering tasks by allowing users to refine their analysis
          dynamically.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Neighborhood Dropdown:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allows users to select a specific neighborhood, dynamically updating both the map
          and bar chart. Enables focused analysis by neighborhood, ensuring the visualization adapts to the user's
          chosen area. This supports retrieve value and filter tasks.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Linked Filtering:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Synchronizes the map and bar chart. Selecting a neighborhood updates both
          visualizations. Creates a cohesive exploration experience, reducing cognitive load and enhancing usability.
          This aligns with best practices for interaction idioms, such as linked highlighting.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Conditional Highlighting:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Highlights the selected neighborhood in full opacity while dimming others. This improves focus and reduces
          visual
          clutter, adhering to the Gestalt principle of figure-ground differentiation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Tooltip Enhancements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tooltips provide precise numerical values for tall tree counts, height ranges, and ranks. This enhances
          interpretability without cluttering the visualization, supporting retrieve value and compute derived value
          tasks.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Tasks Supported</h4>

          counts, neighborhood names, and height range distributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Filter :</strong> Users can filter data by neighborhood (via dropdown) and by tree height (via
          slider).</li>
        <li><strong>Compute Derived Value :</strong> Aggregated metrics like total tree count and tall tree count per
          neighborhood are computed and displayed.</li>
        <li><strong>Find Extremum :</strong> The map highlights neighborhoods with the highest tall tree densities,
          while the bar chart identifies dominant height ranges.</li>
        <li><strong>Sort :</strong> Neighborhoods are implicitly ranked by tall tree counts (via color intensity on the
          map), and height ranges are sorted by tree count in the bar chart.</li>
        <li><strong>Determine Range :</strong> The map's color scale visualizes the span of tall tree counts across
          neighborhoods.</li>
        <li><strong>Characterize Distribution :</strong> The combination of the map and bar chart allows users to
          analyze the spread of tall trees spatially and compositionally.</li>
