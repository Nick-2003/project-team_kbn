    "- Compute: Compute the average percentage differences in `DIAMETER` between planted and non-planted trees, and the ages by the number of days between `DATE_PLANTED` and March 5 2025.\n",
    "- Filter: Filter out `SPECIES_NAME` such that there are plenty of both planted and non-planted trees.\n",
