# Group KBN - Vancouver Trees

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The [Public Tree Dataset](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/public-trees/information/?disjunctive.neighbourhood_name&disjunctive.on_street&disjunctive.species_name&disjunctive.common_name) provides information on public trees in Vancouver, including their location, species, size, planting date, and coordinates. It is published by the City of Vancouver and maintained by the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation. Private trees are not included in the inventory. The dataset refreshes daily on weekdays, with tree attributes updated on a regular basis, though it may be several years between updates for some attributes. Priorities and resources determine how fast a change in reality is reflected in the data. For the purposes of our analysis, we will use data last modified on March 4th, 2025 (City of Vancouver, 2025).
