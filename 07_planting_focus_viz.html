      <h4>Marks</h4>
      <p><strong>Bar plot:</strong></p>
      <p>Used to accurately display the proportions of planted specimens between species, ordered by total number of specimens.</p>
      <p>Bar lengths represent proportions of planted specimens for given species, and color differentiation displays the species' total population size.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Dot plot:</strong></p>
      <p>Used to provide an interpretable display of the variation in proportions and total populations.</p>
      <p>Population size is log-transformed to allow for easier interpretation of values given drastic variations in such.</p>

        </li>
        <li><strong>Color:</strong> Represents the species' total population size, log-transformed, and uses a sequential continuous color palette to display the change in log-transformed total populations, and to display the differences in population sizes should the data be filtered by the widgets.</li>

      <h4>Interaction and UI Widgets</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Genus Dropdown:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Filters trees based on genus, dynamically updating both the histogram and dot plot.</li>
            <li>This ensures the user can apply focused comparisons of counts and proportions between similar species.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Min Total Count Input Box:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Allows users to select a minimum total population size, to ensure that the values displayed have sufficient samples to conduct analyses with.</li>
            <li>Set to 300 by default.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Min Proportion and Max Proportion Sliders:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Allows users to select minimum and maximum proportions of planted species, to find species that can be used for practical analysis of characteristics between planted and non-planted samples.</li>
            <li>Set to 0.3 and 0.7 respectively by default.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bidirectional Selection:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Users can brush on either plot to filter values on both sides.</li>
            <li>Species selection from the bar plot, proportion and log-transformed total count from the dot plot.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Linked Filtering:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensures the bar plot and dot plot remain synchronized. Brushing on either view updates both visualizations, creating a cohesive exploration experience.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Conditional Highlighting:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Upon brushing into specific marks, the opacity of all other related marks are set to be low, drawing attention to the area under analysis, improving focus and reducing cognitive load.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Tooltip Enhancements:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Tooltips provide precise numerical values for proportions of planted specimens and total population size corresponding to each species, enhancing interpretability without cluttering the visualization.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h4>Tasks Supported by the Visualization</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Retrieve Value:</strong> Tooltips allow users to extract specific details, such as proportions of planted specimens and total population size corresponding to each species.</li>
        <li><strong>Filter:</strong> Users can filter data by genus selection (via dropdown), selection of boundaries for population size (via textbox) and proportions of planted specimens (via sliders), and brushing within either plot, enabling focused exploration.</li>
        <li><strong>Compute Derived Value:</strong> To obtain the proportion of planted specimens over the total populations for each species, two aggregations were required. The first aggregation involved counting the number of trees with explicit DATE_PLANTED values grouped by species, under the assumption that all trees without the DATE_PLANTED were not planted trees, while the second involved counting the total number trees for the species that had DATE_PLANTED specimens. The proportion was obtained by dividing the number of planted specimens over the total number of specimens for each species.</li>
        <li><strong>Sort:</strong> Species in the bar plot are are sorted by population size.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  
    <div class="section">
      <h4>Why These Choices Were Effective</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Aggregating proportion of planted specimens over the total populations for each species ensures the visualization is concise and focused on species with sufficiently large amounts of samples to conduct analyses with.</li>
            <li>Filtering the dataset avoids overwhelming users with less relevant data while still providing meaningful insights into planted proportions.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Analysis:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The bar plot and dot plot visualise variations of proportions of planted specimens across species and population sizes.</li>
            <li>Together, they allow users to discover which species has sufficient data for both planted and non-planted specimens through the combinations of the total number of trees and the proportion of planted samples.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Exploration:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The dropdown menu, input box, sliders and bidirectional interactions allow users to explore the data dynamically, refining their analysis based on genus, population size, proportions and species.</li>
            <li>Linked filtering ensures consistency between the bar plot and dot plot, maintaining a seamless exploration experience.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Interpretability:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Tooltips and conditional highlighting make the visualization accessible to a wide audience, supporting informed decision-making about species with greater flexibility in terms of what species could be focused on.</li>
          </ul>
