    <div class="section">
      <h4>Tasks Supported by the Visualization</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Retrieve Value:</strong> Tooltips allow users to extract specific details, such as proportions of
          planted specimens and total population size corresponding to each species.</li>
        <li><strong>Filter:</strong> Users can filter data by genus selection (via dropdown), selection of boundaries
          for population size (via textbox) and proportions of planted specimens (via sliders), and brushing within
          either plot, enabling focused exploration.</li>
        <li><strong>Compute Derived Value:</strong> To obtain the proportion of planted specimens over the total
          populations for each species, two aggregations were required. The first aggregation involved counting the
          number of trees with explicit DATE_PLANTED values grouped by species, under the assumption that all trees
          without the DATE_PLANTED were not planted trees, while the second involved counting the total number trees for
          the species that had DATE_PLANTED specimens. The proportion was obtained by dividing the number of planted
          specimens over the total number of specimens for each species.</li>
        <li><strong>Sort:</strong> Species in the bar plot are are sorted by population size.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Why These Choices Were Effective</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Aggregating proportion of planted specimens over the total populations for each species ensures the
              visualization is concise and focused on species with sufficiently large amounts of samples to conduct
              analyses with.</li>
            <li>Filtering the dataset avoids overwhelming users with less relevant data while still providing meaningful
              insights into planted proportions.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Analysis:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The bar plot and dot plot visualise variations of proportions of planted specimens across species and
              population sizes.</li>
            <li>Together, they allow users to discover which species has sufficient data for both planted and
              non-planted specimens through the combinations of the total number of trees and the proportion of planted
              samples.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Exploration:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The dropdown menu, input box, sliders and bidirectional interactions allow users to explore the data
              dynamically, refining their analysis based on genus, population size, proportions and species.</li>
            <li>Linked filtering ensures consistency between the bar plot and dot plot, maintaining a seamless
              exploration experience.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Interpretability:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Tooltips and conditional highlighting make the visualization accessible to a wide audience, supporting
              informed decision-making about species with greater flexibility in terms of what species could be focused
              on.</li>

      <h4>Further Developments</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The intended functionality for this visualisation was that the user could select a specific neighbourhood in
          the choropleth to filter the display of species counts. However, as of this writing, the function has not been
          implemented, and external assistance is required to resolve it.</li>
        <li>The selected baseline of species variation may not be sufficient, and thus further UI widgets to provide
          options for such may be considered.</li>
        <li>The sheer quantity of neighbourhoods means that the neighbourhood locations in the bar plot run the risk of
          being indiscriminable.</li>

      <h4>Tasks Supported by the Visualization</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Retrieve Value:</strong> Tooltips allow users to extract specific details, such as counts in
          specific ranges and percentage changes for species.</li>
        <li><strong>Filter:</strong> Users can filter data by genus (via dropdown) and by brushing in histogram,
          enabling focused exploration.</li>
        <li><strong>Compute Derived Value:</strong> Differences in height and diameter between planted and non-planted
          trees are obtained by calculating the average height and diameter for each species, then comparing the
          percentage change from non-planted trees to planted trees. Since the dataset only provides height ranges for
          each specimen, the heights for the trees had to be estimated by using the averages for each range, with the
          >90 category being estimated with 100 m.</li>
        <li><strong>Sort:</strong> Neighborhoods are implicitly ranked by tall tree counts (via color intensity on the
          map), and height ranges are sorted by tree count in the bar chart.</li>
        <li><strong>Characterize Distribution:</strong> The combination of the historgam and dot plot allows users to
          analyze the distribution of changes in height and diameter.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Why These Choices Were Effective</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Analysis:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The histogram provides an overview of the distribution of height changes.</li>
            <li>The dot plot displays the changes in diameter changes across species.</li>
            <li>These combined provide a better understanding of how drastically certain planted trees may differ
              compared to their naturally grown counterparts.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Exploration:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The dropdown menu and histogram brush allow users to explore the data dynamically, refining their
              analysis based on genus and height range.</li>
            <li>Linked filtering ensures consistency between the histogram and dot plot, maintaining a seamless
              exploration experience.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Interpretability:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Conditional highlighting and tooltips improve clarity, making it easier for users to interpret the data
              and make informed decisions about identifying plants that grow differently from their naturally-grown
              counterparts.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Further developments</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The displayed data is limited by the inability to ensure that there are sufficient planted and non-planted
          samples for each given species. Thus the calculated differences in diameter and height may be highly skewed
          and otherwise inaccurate, and will need to be accounted for in the future.</li>
        <li>Similarly, any species that does not have sufficient data needs to be shown as well in some form.</li>
      </ul>
